      <h2>My Strengths</h2>
      <p>
        Making albums is my calling card. With 8 albums that are currently on
        Apple Music, there are plenty of songs you can listen to. I'm also
        experienced and comfortable with being behind the camera. I've played a
        role in a total of 10 movies. One of them being "Anchorman 2: The Legend
        Continues".
